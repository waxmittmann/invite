                    <h1>Invitation to our Re-Post-Ception</h1>
                    <p>Dear __ (and __),</p>
                    <p>Celine and Max would like to invite you to our re-post-ception barbeque on the 13th of June of this fine year 2015 following our wedding on the 12th.</p>
                    </p>It's a firmly informal event, so no shirts or fancy pants please! (You might want to bring a good pullover and/or jacket though).</p>
                    <p>We'll be providing foodstuff of both the vegetarian and carnivorous variety, though if you have any special likes / requirements or just want to bring a dish please feel free.</p>
                    <p>Also, please bring along your own booze if you'd like to get mildly / moderately /   propely but safely sloshed.</p>
                    <p>We look forward to seeing you there!</p>

                    <p>We would cordially like to invite you to our wedding, 'cause you are our super-best friend and we love you. Blah Blah Blah. 
                        “That look in his eyes should have warned me even before he started talking.</p>
        <p>“We want to use a parallel supercomputer for a numerical calculation up to 1,000,000,000, but we need a faster algorithm to do it.”
        I’d seen that distant look before. Eyes dulled from too much exposure to the raw horsepower of supercomputers—machines so fast that brute force seemed to eliminate the need for clever algorithms; at least until the problems got hard enough.</p>

                    In her 2013 post-budget interview with Mr Swan, Sales' first question was: "Wayne Swan last year you promised with certainty a $1.5 billion surplus, tonight you've delivered an $18 billion deficit. How can you look Australians in the eye?"
